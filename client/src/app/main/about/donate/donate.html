        <p>When I created this app, I never imaged it would be as popular as it has become.</p>
        <p>I just wanted to sling some code while creating a tool that would help craft the perfect mix of classes to take every semester.</p>
        <p>Since launching in November 2015, usage has skyrocketed. We now have thousands of active users consuming gigabytes of data per month. We're also storing <strong>a lot</strong> of data.</p>
        <p>This is especially obvious during registration periods when we as a community quickly surpass Firebase's usage limits.</p>
        <p>A huge shoutout goes to those who have already graciously donated their money to allow sustaining the app, hopefully making picking a course easier for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>To keep the momentum going, I need your support. We're currently on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Firebase's Flame Plan</a> @ $25/month.</p>
        <h3>November 19, 2017 Update: We exceeded the Flame Plan's Quota and are transferring ownership.  Worst case the site will be back up on December 1st.  Best case, the owner transfer will reset the clock and we'll figure out how to reduce bandwidth.</h3>
        <p>Please consider making a contribution (<a href="https://www.paypal.me/martz" target="_blank">PayPal</a>). Even a dollar goes a long way. Thank you!</p>
